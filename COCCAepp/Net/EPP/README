EPP is the Extensible Provisioning Protocol. EPP (defined in RFC 3730) is an
application layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and management of
objects stored in a shared central repository. Specified in XML, the protocol
defines generic object management operations and an extensible framework that
maps protocol operations to objects. As of writing, its only well-developed
application is the provisioning of Internet domain names, hosts, and related
contact details.  

RFC 3734 defines a TCP based transport model for EPP, and the Net_EPP_Client
class included in this distribution implements a client for that model. You can
establish and manage EPP connections and send and receive responses over these
connections.

The class is organised on similar lines to the Net::EPP::Client Perl module.
Full documentation for the class is included in HTML format in the doc/
subdirectory, but you can generate your own using phpdoc.
